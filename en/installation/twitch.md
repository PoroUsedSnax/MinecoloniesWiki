# Minecraft Java Edition

## Installing Miecolonies Mod on your original Minecraft Launcher. NO Twitch Client, no other mods.

* This process is for installing only the Minecolonies mod in your original Minecraft launcher. You will _not_ be able to connect to the ***Minecolonies Official 1.12.2***  Server due to the server having a balanced variety of other mods as well.

* For connecting to the Official Server, install the Twitch Client or visit the [https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/minecolonies-testpack] site for a zip file containing all mods used on Server. If all these additional mods are downloaded and installed as well, you will be able to connect to the official Server. 

### The Official Minecolonies Server Address is:

* Installation of the MineColonies mod is very simple. It does require Minecraft Forge to be able to integrate minecolonies mod into the Minecraft game.


_We cannot offer support on the installation of Minecraft Forge. This guide is meant as a general guide for the original Minecraft launcher only for current version 1.12.2 (as of the writing of this post)._
 
* Go to the [http://files.minecraftforge.net/?forums Minecraft Forge] files download section and Download the "Recommended" Version.

* Run the downloaded recommended version and make sure it's on "Install Client". Installation path is preset according to Minecraft's original installation path. If you have it installed in a different directory change the installation directory. When it's done you will see a "Complete" message.

Once you have successfully installed Forge, follow these steps:
* Go to the [[https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/minecolonies/files Minecolonies Curse Forge Download]] site and download the latest 1.12.2 version of MineColonies.
* On your computer go to the ".minecraft/mods" folder. To be able to find this folder, just click on the start button and in the search box type: %appdata% and hit "search". It will open the folder where you can find the " .minecraft " folder. Open this folder and inside you will find the " mods " folder.
* Once you are in the " .minecraft/mods " folder, copy the downloaded Minecolonies file you downloaded in Step 1 and paste it here. NOTE: DO NOT extract the file if the option appears. Just put the .jar file in here without extracting it's contents.
* Run your Original Minecraft launcher and make sure you have the " forge " profile loaded and hit Play

That's it. If you followed thses steps you are READY to play Minecolonies!
